    <h1>Pierogi ruskie</h1>
    <img src="../images/pierogi.jpg" alt="pierogi">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Potato pierogi, or pierogi ruskie (pyeh-RROH-ghee RROOSS-kyeh), are among the most popular types of Polish dumplings. A traditional Polish dish that is found in several variations, such as sweet and savory, these dumplings are a staple of Eastern European cuisine and are a type of comfort food that all households hold dear.</p>
    <p>Despite what the name sounds like, pierogi ruskie doesn't translate to "Russian pierogi" but refers to the Ruthenians or Rusyns, the people from around the northern Carpathian Mountains in western Ukraine, eastern Slovakia, and southern Poland.</p>  
    
    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
    <h4>For the potatoes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds russet potatoes, scrubbed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the potatoes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced onion</li>
        <li>8 ounces farmer cheese, or dry curd, or ricotta, at room temperature</li>
        <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 to 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour/li>
        <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 to 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Parboil the potatoes in a large saucepan by covering them with cold water and adding 1 tablespoon of salt.</li>
        <li>Bring the potatoes to a boil over high heat, then reduce to medium-low, cover with a lid, and simmer for 30 minutes, or until fork-tender. Drain and let cool slightly.</li>
        <li>While the potatoes are parboiling, place the butter in a small pan, add the onion, and sauté over medium-low heat for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Peel the cooked potatoes, place them in a large bowl, and mash them with a fork or potato ricer.</li>
        <li>Add the sautéed onion and farmer cheese to the potatoes and mix well. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place 2 cups of flour in a large bowl or on a work surface and make a well in the center.</li>
        <li>Break the egg into it, then add 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 cup of lukewarm water, a little at a time.</li>
        <li>Bring the dough together, kneading well and adding the remaining flour or water as needed to form a smooth dough ball.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough in half and cover it with a bowl or towel. Let it rest 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Assemble the pierogi on a floured work surface by rolling out the dough to 1/8 inch in thickness. Using a 2-inch round cookie cutter or drinking glass, make small circles.</li>
        <li>Spoon 1 1/2 teaspoons of the filling onto the middle of each circle.</li>
        <li>Fold the dough in half to form a half-circle shape and then firmly pinch the edges together.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a baking sheet with flour and place the filled pierogi on it in a single layer. Keep the formed pierogi under a clean kitchen towel to stop them from drying.</li>
        <li>Gather scraps, reroll, and fill until you've used all of the first half of the dough. Repeat the process with the remaining half of dough.</li>
        <li>Cook the pierogi by bringing a large, low saucepan of salted water to a rapid boil. Depending on the size of your pot, drop in about 6 to 10 pierogi at a time, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. Return the water to a boil and reduce the heat to a simmer. When the pierogi rise to the surface, continue to simmer a few more minutes. It should take around 5 to 6 minutes for the pierogi to be cooked.</li>
