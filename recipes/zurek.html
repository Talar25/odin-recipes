    <p>It’s also known in Belarusian, Czech and Slovak cuisines under a different name.</p> 
    
    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8.5 cups (2 litres, 0.5 gallon) meat stock (chicken, mixed-meat, rosół works great too)</li>
        <li>7 oz (200g) unsliced bacon</li>
        <li>1 (200g, 7 oz) medium white onion</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots (roughly 4.2 oz, 120g)</li>
        <li>2 parsley roots (roughly 4.2 oz, 120g) - can be substituted for a celery root)</li>
        <li>4 links (500g, 1.1 lb) white kiełbasa sausage (fresh, uncooked)</li>
        <li>2 ¼ cups (500ml) Sour Rye Flour Starter (link to a recipe in the notes)</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>3 tbsp whipping cream (optional, 30-36% fat)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp dried marjoram</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Pepper (freshly ground) to taste</li>
        <li>4 boiled eggs, halved</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Get a cooking pot. Pour in the stock and start heating it up (on a medium heat).</li>
        <li>Chop bacon and onion into small cubes. Using a frying pan, fry up the bacon first. There is need to add any additional frying fat, bacon will release plenty of its own.</li>
        <li>Once the bacon fat has rendered, add the onion pieces and continue frying until both ingredients turn golden.</li>
        <li>Move the contents of the frying pan into the pot with cooking stock. If your ‘zakwas’ starter was fermented without spices (that is: bay leaves, all-spice berries and peppercorns), it’s a good moment to add them directly into the soup. I place them inside a mesh spice bag/stock sachet, so that I don't have to struggle fishing them out later.</li>
        <li>Peel carrots and parsley roots, drop them whole into the stock.</li>
        <li>Add white kiełbasa (uncut, whole links) as well and continue cooking for 30-40 minutes, until the stock becomes meaty in aroma and flavour (you’ll have to test that empirically).</li>
        <li>If you haven’t boiled the eggs already, now is a good moment to do so. Once cooked, allow them to cool down.</li>
        <li>The next step would be to remove the spices. If you used the spice bag, just take it out. Otherwise, you can fish them out manually with a spoon, or get rid of them using a sieve - and return the soup into the pot.</li>
        <li>Now it’s time to add rye 'zakwas' starter. Add 1⅓ cup (300ml) of zakwas for a mild Żurek, up to 2 cups (or more; roughly 500ml) for a more sour result. If you’re not sure how much you should add, just pour it over gradually, tasting along the way.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon of dried marjoram and one garlic clove (crushed or roughly chopped), cook for another 4-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from heat. Remove the sausage and vegetables with a slotted spoon, slice them all and return to the pot. You can also leave the sausage unsliced - that’s up to you.</li>
        <li>Adding cream is optional, but it balances the flavours very nicely. Place 3 tablespoons of whipping cream into a cup or a small bowl. Add in a tablespoon of Żurek, mix well with a fork. And another spoonful of soup and mix again. Repeat with 2 more tablespoons of Żurek. Pour the mixture into the pot.</li>
        <li>Have a taste. Does it need any more salt or a pinch of pepper? If so, add some to taste. Garnish with fresh marjoram or chopped parsley and serve with boiled egg halves.</li>
        <li>Smacznego!</li>
